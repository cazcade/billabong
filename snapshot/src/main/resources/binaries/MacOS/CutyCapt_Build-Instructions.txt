Check out CutyCapt source.

   svn co https://cutycapt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cutycapt

Download latest version of QT (currently 4.6) from http://qt.nokia.com.

Install QT

Ensure that paths are set up correctly (normally handled by install): http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.6/install-mac.html

Open a terminal window in the CutyCapt directory where the CutyCapt.pro file is and run qmake.

This generates an XCode project that can then be opened and built. This generates CutyCapt.app which contains the
command line binary which is needed.

The binary needs the QT runtime to be available on the machine where it is run.

Note that this should be very similar for Linux.
